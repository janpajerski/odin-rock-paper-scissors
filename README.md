# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is my first JavaScrip project built from scratch and is part of the Odin Project. I am using this readme file to record my project notes and my thought process. I learned about how progammers think and problem solve (at least how you should) and I will follow the process rigidly so it gets ingrained. Bear with me here, as it's probably overkill given the level of difficult :)
